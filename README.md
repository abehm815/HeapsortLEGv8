# LEGv8 Heapsort Implementation

This project implements the **Heapsort algorithm** in LEGv8 assembly language for use with the custom LEGv8 emulator provided by Iowa State University.

This assignment was completed as part of **CS 321: Computer Architecture and Machine-Level Programming**.

## Overview

The program sorts an array of integers using the Heapsort algorithm. Due to the low-level nature of LEGv8 assembly, the implementation is broken into multiple modular procedures to manage complexity and maintain adherence to **ARMv8 calling conventions**.
